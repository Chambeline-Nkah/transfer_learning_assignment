Problem statement

Early and accurate detection of plant diseases remains a challenge in the agricultural sector, and this has drastically affected global food security. Manual methods used by farmers, such as visual inspection, are unreliable as they are time-consuming and limited in scale. These methods tend to miss the early stages, thereby reducing productivity. By developing a deep CNN image classifier for plant disease detection, it is possible to automate the processes, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency and leading to increased crop yield and more sustainable agricultural practices.

Overview of the dataset

The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset) contains images of potato leaves with three common diseases: early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves. The dataset consists of a total of 1,500 images, with 500 images for each class (early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves). The images have a resolution of 256x256 pixels.
